# Recurrent Neural Network

Common neural network structures include Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). MLP and CNN are relatively simple, while RNN has unique advantages in handling sequential data and is also a relatively difficult model to understand. This article will introduce the basic concepts and applications of RNN.

## Construction, Training, and Prediction of RNN

## Long Short-Term Memory Networks

## Application - Image Captioning
